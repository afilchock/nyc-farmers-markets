    <h1>Farmers Markets in New York City</h1>
    </div><section id="intro">
      <p>This space is intended to explore the location of New York City's farmers markets in relation to food deserts and higher income neighborhoods. 
        It will attempt to reveal whether these markets are serving a critical need in areas lacking financial and food resources, 
        or if they are located in areas that don't need to depend on them.</p>
