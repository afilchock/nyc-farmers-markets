Fall 22 javascript final project - NYC Farmers Markets 

I plan to create a website with an interactive map that highlights local farmers markets in NYC. I want to explore urban food infrastructure up against food deserts (and higher income areas) to see where farmers markets might fill some gaps. There will be buttons and images for each site so the user can explore facts and information about how these markets support their local communities. Additionally, I want to add a layer that represents the average income level in each neighborhood. Finally, I’ll draw lines and make visual connections to the nearest low income/public housing in relation to the farmers market.

In order to stay on top of scope, I’ll start with just the borough of Manhattan and then see what the level of effort is for expanding to another borough. I’ll access data from NYC Open Data and the NYC Urban Design Forum’s Neighborhood Fare.
